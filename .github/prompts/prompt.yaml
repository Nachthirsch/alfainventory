  - All interactive elements should be UI-only (no API calls, no state management logic)
  - Responsive design:  mobile-first approach (sm, md, lg, xl breakpoints)
  - Modern, clean, professional design aesthetic
  - Use Lucide React for icons (import from 'lucide-react')
  
  TECH STACK: 
  - React 18+ (functional components only)
  - TailwindCSS (utility-first styling)
  - Lucide React (icons)
  - No additional UI libraries (build from scratch with Tailwind)

implementation_guidelines:
  component_structure:  |
    - Each component in its own file
    - Use functional components with hooks (useState for UI state only)
    - Props destructuring in function parameters
    - No business logic - UI only
    - All data passed as props from mock data
  
  styling_approach: |
    - Use Tailwind utility classes only
    - No custom CSS files
    - Responsive classes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
    - Use @apply only if absolutely necessary (prefer inline utilities)
    - Consistent spacing using Tailwind scale (p-4, gap-6, etc.)
  
  state_management: |
    - Use useState for UI state only (modal open/close, tab selection, etc.)
    - NO Redux, NO Context API for data
    - NO API calls or data fetching
    - All data from mock data files
  
  interactivity: |
    - onClick handlers for UI actions (open modal, change tab, etc.)
    - Form inputs with onChange for controlled components
    - Button disabled states
    - Hover effects with Tailwind hover:  variants
    - NO form submission logic
    - NO data mutation (just UI simulation)
  
  code_quality: |
    - Clean, readable code with proper indentation
    - Descriptive component and variable names
    - Comments for complex UI logic
    - Consistent formatting
    - PropTypes or TypeScript types (optional but recommended)

mock_data_approach:  |
  Create a comprehensive mockData.js file with organized sections:
  - dashboardData (KPIs, stock items, alerts, charts)
  - posData (menu items, categories)
  - productsData (products list, ingredients, recipes)
  - inventoryData (current stock, movements, adjustments)
  - reportsData (all report statistics and tables)
  
  Import and use this data in components as props. 
  No data transformation logic - keep it simple and static.

icon_usage: |
  Import icons from lucide-react: 
  import { TrendingUp, ShoppingCart, Package, AlertTriangle } from 'lucide-react'
  
  Common icons to use:
  - TrendingUp/TrendingDown:  trends
  - ShoppingCart: sales/POS
  - Package: products
  - Warehouse: inventory
  - BarChart3: reports
  - AlertTriangle: warnings
  - CheckCircle: success
  - XCircle: errors
  - Plus/Minus: add/remove
  - Edit/Trash: actions
  - Search: search functionality
  - Filter: filtering
  - Download: export
  - Printer: print
  - Eye: view details
  - Settings: configuration

critical_requirements:  |
  DO: 
  - Create pixel-perfect UI with Tailwind
  - Use mock data for everything
  - Focus on visual design and layout
  - Make responsive for all screen sizes
  - Use Lucide icons consistently
  - Create reusable components
  - Add hover and focus states
  - Use proper color coding (green=safe, yellow=warning, red=danger)
  - Format currency properly (Rp X,XXX,XXX)
  - Add empty states for tables/lists
  
  DON'T:
  - Add backend logic or API calls
  - Implement authentication
  - Add state management libraries (Redux, Zustand)
  - Create database schemas
  - Add form validation logic (just UI feedback)
  - Implement actual calculations (use pre-calculated mock values)
  - Add routing logic (just create page components)
  - Worry about data persistence
  - Add complex business logic

deliverable:  |
  Generate complete React components with:
  1. All 5 main page components (Dashboard, POS, Products, Inventory, Reports)
  2. All shared/reusable components (Navigation, Modal, Table, Form elements, etc.)
  3. Page-specific components (StatCard, MenuCard, ProductTable, etc.)
  4. Comprehensive mockData.js file with all data structures
  5. App.jsx with basic structure (no routing needed, just render one page at a time)
  6. Each component fully styled with TailwindCSS
  7. Responsive design implemented
  8. All interactive UI elements (buttons, modals, tabs work visually)
  
  Focus on creating a beautiful, professional UI that looks production-ready, even though it's static/mock.
